 CURRENT MARKETING ISSUES:
 1. How to make advertisements more interactive to be more effective
 2. How to best take advantage of Facebook and Twitter conservations about the company and industry
 3.  To use exclusive dealerships or multiple channels of distribution
 4. To use heavy, light, or no TV advertising versus  online advertising
 5.  To limit (or not) the share of business done with a single customer
 6.  To be a price leader or a price follower
 7.  To offer a complete or limited warranty

CURRENT MARKETING ISSUES
	 ►Firms should provide incentives to consumers to share their thoughts, opinions, and experiences on the company website
	 ►The company website must not be all about the company—it must be all about the customer too

THE NEW PRINCIPLES OF MARKETING
 1. Do not just talk at consumers—work with them throughout the marketing process.
 2. give consumers a reason to participate.
 3. Listen to—and join—the conversation outside your company’s website.
 4. resist the temptation to sell, sell, sell. instead attract, attract, attract.
 5. Do not control online conversations; let it flow freely.
 6. Find a “marketing technologist,” a person who has three excellent skill sets (marketing, 
technology, and social interaction).
 7. embrace instant messaging and chatting.


ADVERTISING MEDIA
	 ►Internet advertising is growing so rapidly that marketers are more and more allowed to create bigger, more intrusive ads that take up more space on the web page
	 ►Websites are allowing lengthier ads to run before short video clips play
	 ►Blogs are creating more content that doubles also as an ad

INTERACTIVE MARKETING
	► redesigning websites to be more interactive. 
	► building new sponsorship programs and other enticements on websites. 
	► mixing editorial and advertising content  on blogs.
 
MARKET SEGMENTATION
	►subdividing of a market into distinct subsets of customers according to needs and buying habits
	►widely used in implementing strategies

	►Strategies such as market development, product development, market penetration, and diversification require increased sales through new markets and products
	►Market segmentation allows a firm to operate with limited resources because mass production, mass distribution, and mass advertising are not required
	►Market segmentation decisions directly affect marketing mix variables: product, place, promotion, and price
	

RETENTION BASED SEGMENTATION
 Tag #1: Is this customer at high risk of canceling the company’s service?
 Tag #2: Is this customer worth retaining?
 Tag #3: What retention tactics should be used to retain this customer?

DOES THE INTERNET MAKE MARKET 
SEGMENTATION EASIER?
 ►The segments of people whom marketers want to 
reach online are much more precisely defined than 
the segments of people reached through traditional 
forms of media, such as television, radio, and 
magazines
 ►People in essence segment themselves by nature 
of the websites that comprise their “favorite places,”
 and many of these websites sell information 
regarding their “visitors”

PRODUCT POSITIONING
 ►Product positioning
 ►entails developing schematic representations 
that reflect how your products or services 
compare to competitors’ on dimensions most 
important to success in the industry
 9-19
 
PRODUCT POSITIONING STEPS
 1. Select key criteria that effectively differentiate 
products or services in the industry.
 2.  Diagram a two-dimensional product-positioning 
map with specified criteria on each axis.
 3. Plot major competitors’ products or services in 
the resultant four-quadrant matrix.
 9-20
 
PRODUCT POSITIONING STEPS
 4.  Identify areas in the positioning map where the 
company’s products or services could be most 
competitive in the given target market. Look for 
vacant areas (niches).
 5. Develop a marketing plan to position the 
company’s products or services appropriately.

RULES FOR USING PRODUCT 
POSITIONING AS A STRATEGY
IMPLEMENTATION TOOL
 1. Look for the hole or vacant niche.
 2.  Don’t serve two segments with the same 
strategy.
 3.  Don’t position yourself in the middle of the  
map.

PRODUCT POSITIONING
 ►
 An effective product positioning strategy meets 
two criteria: 
it uniquely distinguishes a company from the 
competition
 ►
 it leads customers to expect slightly less 
service than a company can deliver

IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES
 ►Successful strategy implementation often 
requires additional capital 
►Besides net profit from operations and the 
sale of assets, two basic sources of capital 
for an organization are debt and equity
 9-27
 
ACQUIRING CAPITAL TO 
IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES
 ►EPS = Earnings Per Share, which is Net Income 
divided by # of Shares Outstanding. 
►Another term for Shares Outstanding is Shares 
Issued
 ►EBIT = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (also 
called operating income)

ACQUIRING CAPITAL TO 
IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES
 ►When using EPS/EBIT analysis, timing in relation to 
movements of stock prices, interest rates, and bond 
prices becomes important 
►In times of high stock prices, stock may prove to be 
the best alternative 
►However, when cost of capital (interest rates) is 
low, debt is more attractive

PROJECTED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 ►Projected Financial Statements
 ►allows an organization to examine the expected 
results of various actions and approaches
 ►allows an organization to compute projected 
financial ratios under various strategy
implementation scenarios
 9-32
 
PERFORMING PROJECTED 
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

the balance sheet
 2. Use the percentage-of-sales method to project 
cost of goods sold (CGS) and the expense 
items in the income statement
 3. Calculate the projected net income
 4. Subtract from the net income any dividends to 
be paid for that year
 9-33

obtained and spent for a specified period of time
 ►include cash budgets, operating budgets, sales 
budgets, profit budgets, factory budgets, capital 
budgets, expense budgets, divisional budgets, 
variable budgets, flexible budgets, and fixed 
budgets
 9-35
 
LIMITATIONS OF FINANCIAL BUDGETS

 ►Budgets can hide 
inefficiencies if based 
solely on precedent 
rather than on periodic
 evaluation of 
circumstances and 
standards
 ►Budgets are sometimes 
used as instruments of 
tyranny that result in 
frustration, resentment, 
absenteeism, and high 
turnover

EVALUATING THE WORTH OF A 
BUSINESS
 Three main approaches: 
►What a firm owns
 ►What a firm earns
 ►What a firm will bring in the market
 9-38
 
EVALUATING THE WORTH OF A 
BUSINESS
 ►The first approach is determining a firm’s net 
worth or stockholders’ equity
 ►The second approach is based on the future 
benefits a firm’s owners may derive through 
net profits
 9-39
 
EVALUATING THE WORTH OF A 
BUSINESS
 ►The third approach is to divide the market 
price of the firm’s common stock by the 
annual earnings per share and multiply this 
number by the firm’s average net income for 
the past five years 
►Also called the price-earnings ratio method
 9-40
 
EVALUATING THE WORTH OF A 
BUSINESS
 ►The fourth method is to simply multiply the 
number of shares outstanding by the market 
price per share 
►Also called the outstanding shares method

ISSUES
 1.   
2.   
3.   
4.   
5.   
6.   
7.   
Emphasize product or process improvements
 Stress basic or applied research
 Be leaders or followers in R&D

R&D APPROACHES FOR IMPLEMENTING 
STRATEGIES
 ►Be the first firm to market new technological 
products
 ►Be an innovative imitator of successful products, 
thus minimizing the risks and costs of start-up
 ►Be a low-cost producer by mass-producing 
products similar to but less expensive than 
products recently introduced

analytics is that it is predictive rather than 
retrospective, in that it enables a firm to learn 
from experience and make current and future 
decisions based on prior information
